USE 7zip for file paths too long - 
SHIFT ENTF to permanently delete without recycle bin

delete FILE
Tap on the Windows-key, type cmd.exe and select the result to load the command prompt.
Navigate to the folder that you want to delete (with all its files and subfolders). Use cd path, e.g. cd o:\backups\test\ to do so.
The command DEL /F/Q/S *.* > NUL deletes all files in that folder structure, and omits the output which improves the process further.

DELETE folder 
CD D:\MIG_SHARE_BD\Alligator_Files_ID
DEL /F/Q/S *.* > NUL

RMDIR "\\des80040.nycomed.local\MIG_SHARE_BD\Alligator_Files_ID" /S /Q

this fails if path too long
rmdir Z:\ /s

ROBOCOPY for long file paths
IF possible do from Contiki server if files located there takes only seconds but a LONG time on laptop
Create an empty folder, such as C:\TEMP\Temp\_TRASH
takes quite a while but works (deletes file by file on cmd window)
background option?

Open a Command Prompt window.
Type 
robocopy C:\TEMP\Temp\_TRASH Z:\ /purge
